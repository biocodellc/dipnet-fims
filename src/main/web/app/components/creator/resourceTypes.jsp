    <div class="sectioncontent">
       Following is a listing of resource types available to bcids.  We have chosen to restrict resources to those types
       commonly in use in the Bio-collections community.  ResourceTypes draw on Dublin Core (dcterms and dctype),
        Darwin Core (dwc), the Information Artifact Ontology (iao), the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI),
        the Environment Ontology (envo), and the RDF schema (rdfs).
