Diversity of the Indo-Pacific Network (DIPnet) Field Information Management System (FIMS)
</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

A primary goal of DIPnet is to develop a web-based database and infrastructure to aid collaboration and the cross-dissemination of published data.

The following workflow is used for working with Metadata and Sequence Files in the FIMS system:
